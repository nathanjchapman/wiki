## The 5 Basic Accounts

Basic accounting rules group all finance related things into 5 fundamental types of “accounts”. That is, everything that accounting deals with can be placed into one of these 5 accounts:

### Account types

**Assetsa**
Things you own

**Liabilities**
Things you owe

**Equity**
Overall net worth

**Income**
Increases the value of your accounts

**Expenses**
Decreases the value of your accounts

It is clear that it is possible to categorize your financial world into these 5 groups. For example, the cash in your bank account is an asset, your mortgage is a liability, your paycheck is income, and the cost of dinner last night is an expense.

The first equation:
`A - L = E + (i - e)`
Assets - Liabilites = Equity + (income - expenses)
